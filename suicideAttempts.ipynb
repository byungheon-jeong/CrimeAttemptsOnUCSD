    "## Introduction and Background\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "Do midterms and assignment deadlines in quarter system increase level of stress? Are suicide rates among students significantly higher during mid-quarter when students have to attend to midterms and homework?\n",
    "\n",
    "Being university students, we feel like the pressure of midterms can be overwhelming especially quarter system seem so fast-paced. So, we questioned if the stress from student obligations affects the suicide rates during \"midterm season\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Since all the UCSD police department incident reports are publicly accessable and stored as PDF files (www.police.ucsd.edu/docs/reports/CallsandArrests/Calls_and_Arrests.asp), we can clean and process the data to incidents we would like to analyze. To test our hypothesises' validity, we will use Chi-square test to test whether stress affects the suicide rates during mid-quater.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background and Prior Work\n",
    "Nick obtained the dataset approximately a year ago, however, was unable to process the information due to the lack of knowledge required at the time. The 1000+ obtained files contained no clear tables, missing and inconsistent rows, spelling mistakes, and many variants of similar wordings. It wasn't until the Spring Break of 2019 that he obtained the knowledge required to clean and process all the data in the PDF files.\n",
    "Only a small portion of the dataset will be used, but it should be enough to build a time series regression model with an accuracy ideally above guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cross-compare our results with the information against the 2016-17 annual UCSD CAPS reports from the other UC's, in order to see if UCSD is lacking in mental health aid for students and faculty. In total, suicide total incidents include the following from the CAPS information: Suicide Completed, Suicide Attempts (serious, requiring emergency care) and suicide threats. CAPS also allows us to dive into general population that is actually receiving the most amount of clinical care, however, it stops at that not providing information on statistics for the UC general body suicide attempts, etc. If CAPS were to use the clinical stats to prevent potential suicide attempts they can possibly deter thoughts or actions on themselves through outreach programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior studies based on suicide explore more into the victims mental health and pysche in an attempt to anticpate and hopefully prevent a suicide attempt. In \"Clues to Suicide\" by Schneidman and Farberow, raw data of victims' psychiatric case histories, psychological test results, and suicide notes were consolidated so that a statistical comparison might be made. The results of the comparison revealed 3 things:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is pratically impossible to distinguish a possible suicide attempter from details of his case study alone despite how traumatic. For example, many people in one group were children of broken homes, the study showed that the only way to distinguish the members of this group was by getting a record of mental history of the memebers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second study revealed that nearly 75% of the victims who have commited suicide had a history of attempting or threathening to attempt suicide. Showing that such acts and threats should be taken seriously. (Although a suicide threat or gesture does not neccesarily indicate a possible attempter.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost half of the inidividiuals who commited suicide after leaving the hospital did so within 90 days of being discharged. The third indication is more of a time based observation and shows that suicide attempters that have been released from the hospital's care should still be carefully monitored\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "By utilizing police and Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) reports as foundational pieces in our data recording in predicting student suicide attempts. We believe that suicide attempts will trend with the rising levels of stress as students progress through the academic quarter. If such is true, we can then accurately predict the rate of suicide attempts through out the 11 week period of each quarter, with increasing amount of suicide attempts each week of the quarter. Taking the factors listed into consideration we make the assumption that the suicide attempts are correlated to stress from school, and we are mainly finding the rate of attempts throughput the quarter."

    "At first it appears that the monthly rates between the sample and the simulated data are roughly the same. However, upon closer inspection, we see that the rate of attempts actually coincides with the academic quarters. We see that during the breaks (i.e. Summer, Winter, and Spring) there is a dramatic drop. This is perhaps due to a mixture the students leaving campus and therefor decreasing the population and our hypothesis that stress from the progression of the academic quarter leads to a spike in the attempts."

    "## Ethics and Privacy\n",
    " \n",
    "Our topic of investigation entails rather sensitive and personal information. Mental health and suicide, while being a prominent issue that requires attention and care, is still confidential information that should only be disclosed should the person affected wish to share such information. In the crime logs, names and information are listed when an arrest is made, however Nick took the liberty of removing all mentions of names and personal information when cleaning and processing the data. It will be difficult to identify any individual information, as any identifiable information is removed. If this information were to accidentally be released to the public it would seriously jeapordize the personal lives of those involved. While the privacy of survivors is obviously of utmost concern, we are also committed to the protection of recently discharged hospital patients. Studies have shown that almost half of the patients who commit suicide do so within 90 days of being discharged from care. Though it is ultimately the patient's decision regarding what care they wish to receive, it could be beneficial if hospital staff were alerted about this sensitive period and recommended patients to continue to be monitored for a brief period after leaving intensive care.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another ethical concern regards whether by conducting this research, should the dataset collected be useful in lowering and helping prevent suicide/self harm attempts in the future, if it thereby becomes our personal responsibility to ensure that the data is used and the appropriate steps be taken to ensure that action is taken. Though we have exempted ourselves from this responsibility we still uphold the belief that should the data be beneficial, we will put our wholehearted effort into making sure it is used for good. The data is unlikely to be biased as it is provided by the UCPD, which primarily serves the UCSD community more so than the greater San Diego Community. We will ensure that all the information gathered from the police logs have a correlation to the UC system."

    "College students undergo a considerable amount of stress, balancing different aspects of classes, work, student organization, internships, and personal strains. Students are pressured and strained to completely devote their lives to academics, leaving no room for personal care nor leisure time to destress. Large amounts of students develop problems related to mental health, such as issues with depression, anxiety, and isolation. According to the data collected, we can conclude that the quarter system and exams coincide with suicide attempts by students. However it was not the linear increase which we had predicted. The quarter that had the most attempts was Spring quarter, with peaks during weeks 3, 6, and 10, most likely due to midterms and final exams. According to a UCSD CAPS report from 2017, over 57% of students seen at CAPS are female and 33% are first generation students, an important topic to note because of the lack of diversity of people of color, seeing as less than 20% of all UCSD undergraduates are of African-American and Latino descent.\n",

    "There are very important factors that come into play such as academic competition, place of residence, socio-intellectual factors, and financial pressure among other stressors. This problem is not soley reliant on academic struggles but additional factors that are driving students to attempt and commit suicide when placed under this considerable amount of stress. Minorities might feel isolated and alone especially if they are first generation college students that don't know how to naviigate college life and appreciate it to it's full extent. Our research shows that students attempt suicide more during the time of exams and during the spring quarter, but it fails to show the statistics as to how many of those students are minorities and first generation students. Students who are deeply struggling in a system that they had no prior knowledge to."
